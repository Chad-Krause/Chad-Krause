- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chad-Krause
- 👀 I’m interested in Robotics, Cool web apps, and low-level programming. Kinda weird that I like low-level assembly and high-level web apps...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning assembly in my free time. I know a bit from college, but I'm trying to enhance what I've learned, and do some DSP and RTOS with it. Also, I'm learning how to use different communication protocols like CAN.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Not much. I love working on things to a detriment. I volunteer too much time and it's hard for me to focus on one thing.
